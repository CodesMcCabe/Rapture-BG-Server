Rapture-BG
==========

### Background

Rapture-BG is a 2D arena game inspired by Battle Mode from Super Mario Bros. 3. Once the game starts a timer begins and a Monster spawns. The Monster will try to attack the player. If the player is hit once, it's game over. The player has a gun to slay the Monster. Once the Monster is defeated, after a brief pause, the next round begins. The Monster is now stronger. In addition, as time increases during each round, the Monster will get stronger, so time is of the essence!
